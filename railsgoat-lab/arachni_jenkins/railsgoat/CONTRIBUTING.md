# Ways to Contribute to RailsGoat

Thanks for your interest on contributing to RailsGoat!
Here are a few general guidelines on contributing and reporting
bugs to RailsGoat that we ask you to take a look first.
Notice that all of your interactions in the project are
expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting Issues

Before reporting a new issue, please be sure that the issue wasn't
already reported or fixed by searching on GitHub through our
[issues](https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat/issues).

When creating a new issue, be sure to include a **title and clear description**,
as much relevant information as possible, and either a test case example or
even better a **sample Rails app that replicates the issue** -
RailsGoat has a lot of moving parts and it's functionality can be affected
by third party gems, so we need as much context and details as possible
to identify what might be broken for you.

Avoid opening new issues to ask questions in our issues tracker.
Please go through the project wiki, documentation and source code first,
or try to ask your question in our
[Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/C04THC44W).

## Sending Pull Requests

Before sending a new Pull Request, take a look on existing Pull Requests
and Issues to see if the proposed change or fix has been discussed in
the past, or if the change was already implemented but not yet released.

We expect new Pull Requests to include enough tests for new or changed
behavior, and we aim to maintain everything as most backwards compatible
as possible, reserving breaking changes to be ship in major releases
when necessary

If your Pull Request includes new or changed behavior, be sure that the
changes are beneficial to a wide range of use cases or it's an application
specific change that might not be so valuable to other applications.

We also welcome Pull Requests that improve our existing documentation
(both our `README.md` and the doc sections in the source code).

## Other Ways to Contribute

We welcome anyone that wants to contribute to RailsGoat to triage
and reply to open issues to help troubleshoot and fix existing bugs
on RailsGoat. Here is what you can do:

* Help ensure that existing issues follows the recommendations from the
[Reporting Issues template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md),
providing feeback to the issue's author on what might be missing.
* Review and update the existing content of our
[Wiki](https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat/wiki)
with up to date instructions and code samples - the wiki was grown
with several different tutorials and references that we can't keep
track of everything, so if there is a page that showcases an integration
or customization that you are familiar with feel free to update it
as necessary.
* Review existing Pull Requests, and testing patches against real
existing applications that use RailsGoat.

Thanks again for your interest on contributing to the project!
