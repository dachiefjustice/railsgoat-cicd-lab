# Ideas
- Use automation framework with request/response logging: https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/docker/diagnosing-problems/
- Use automation framework with stat test for stats.auth.detect.session._railsgoat_session (or whatever it is)
- firefox-headless isn't available in the ZAP container?
- Run zap from within hold-open container to view log files
- Play with manually configuring auth/session methods in desktop
